# Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Personality Quiz Online

## About

PMD quiz online is a litte project I did in my spare time because I love PMD and I always wanted to do this. I did it once in Unity but I didn't like the result so I decided to do it again in HTML5 using Svelte, TailwindCss and Vite as a bundler. 

I have no idea of what I'm doing, I'm not a web developer, this is my second frontend project (the first one was a simple sign up form to get used to this).

Code is kind of a mess, it works, there are no bugs (that I know) and it works fine. If you want to check the code of this repo as inspiration... Please don't, give me sometime to clean it up.

## Features

- Spanish and English support (auto detect)
- The 63 original questions and natures descriptions
- Original sprites, sounds and music
- Almost identical aesthetic to the original game
- Natures radar chart (NEW)
- Two modes (Normal Quiz and Full Quiz)
- Fully responsive

## Assets used

I tried using the original assets ripped from the game to be as faithful as possible to the game while still adapting it a little to fit these times.

Althought not all assets are mine, here are the sources:

- [Questions [EN] (ripped from html)](https://explorerofsky.github.io/pmd-sky-quiz/)
  - Sorry, your site was the only one well formatted enough to be ripped easily, I asked you for permission but you didn't read me :(
